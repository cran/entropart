  CHANGES IN entropart VERSION 1.2.0
  ==================================

NEW FEATURES 

  o Full support of similarity-based diversity added 

IMPROVEMENTS

  o Default values for arguments added whenever possible.


  CHANGES IN entropart VERSION 1.1.4
  ==================================

NEW FEATURES 

  o Zhang(2012) bias correction for Shannon entropy added. 
  o Zhang and Grabchak (2014) bias correction for Tsallis entropy added. 

BUG CORRECTION 

  o Divest() always calculated neutral diversity of simulated communities so the confidence interval was erroneous for phylodiversity. Corrected.

  CHANGES IN entropart VERSION 1.1.3
  ==================================

NEW FEATURES 

  o Paracou618.dist distance matrix between species of Paracou618.MC added. 


IMPROVEMENTS

  o Imports directive rather than Depends for ade4.
  o mergeandlabels does not return warnings any longer (column names are better addressed).


BUG CORRECTION

  o Legend was not displayed in plot.DivProfile(..., Which="Communities"). Corrected.


  CHANGES IN entropart VERSION 1.1.2
  ==================================
  
NEW FEATURES 

  o Chao, Wang and Jost (2013) bias correction for Shannon entropy added.
  o EntropyCI function added: Entropy of Monte-Carlo simulated communities.
  o Tools to manipulate MetaCommunity objects added (see ?MergeMC)
  o SimTest class added to test a value against a simulated distribution (see ?SimTest).
  o Vignette added.


BUG CORRECTION 

  o Hqz() was erroneous for q!=1. Corrected.
  o bcPhyloEntropy() and bcPhyloDiversity() returned an incorrect $Distribution component. Corrected.
  o summary.MCentropy() did not return the name of the tree. Corrected.
